# Hi! 👋

My name is Manh Phan. I am a senior at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), where I am pursuing a B.S. in computer science with a software engineering concentration. 

I have involved in various teamwork/individual projects, majority of which are developing application and tinkering with robotics. I am working as the Secretary of [Chicago EDT](https://chicagoedt.org/) and I manage our website and media. I am an organizer of [SparkHacks Hackathon @UIC](https://sparkhacks.org/) this year and I am developing our website!
