# To all viewers, Hi! üëã

üëâ My name is Manh Phan. I am a junior studying B.S. in Computer Science with a Software Engineering concentration at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). 

Programming to me is a creative activity. I love creating applications, crafting electronics, and programming robotics. I enjoy seeing results where it is interactive, entertaining, and alive, such as a dreadful defusal bomb, a drone that travels waypoints on its own, and an interactive website that benefits communities. Programming is like magic and programmers are like magicians: as long as you say the correct combination of words, it does magical things for you ‚ú®. 

I learn programming from school, self-teaching, and most importantly through involvement in student organizations. I am the Captain of [EDT Team Air](https://chicagoedt.org/) and we are building a multi-functional autonomous drone that will be competing for [SUAS Competition 2024](https://suas-competition.org/). I am also a member of [ACM Sig-webdev](https://acm-uic.github.io/) where we do web development.
