# To all viewers, Hi! üëã

üëâ My name is Manh Phan. I am a junior studying B.S. in Computer Science with a Software Engineering concentration at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). 

I believe that programmers are magicians. Do you ever experience the time when you try to debug your code for hours, you don‚Äôt see any mistake, but a friend of yours with their ‚Äúmagic hand‚Äù ‚ú® detects the bug in an absurdly simple way? Programmers make things alive, interactive to humans, and eye-catching, just like magic. My passion for programming ignites from that belief. My main interests are mostly dedicated to creating applications, crafting electronics, and programming robotics in Python, C++, and Java.

Like all magicians to perform their magic in the best way, it comes down to practice makes perfect. I practice coding mostly from the knowledge I learned at school, self-teaching, and most importantly through involvement in student organizations. I am the Captain of [EDT Team Air](https://chicagoedt.org/) and we are building a multi-functional autonomous drone that will be competing for [SUAS Competition 2024](https://suas-competition.org/). I am also a member of [ACM Sig-webdev](https://acm-uic.github.io/) where we do web development.
